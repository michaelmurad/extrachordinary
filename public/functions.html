      <h1>Harmonic Functions</h1>
      <div>Harmonic Function is a title that represents the feeling (emotion) that certain chord transmits to the listener.</div>
      <h2>Tonic Function</h3>
      <div>Transmits a feeling of rest, stability and finalization. Promotes the idea of conclusion.</div>
      <h2>Dominant Function</h3>
      <div>Transmits instability and tension feeling. Promotes the idea of preparation for the tonic.</div>
      <h2>Pre-dominant</h3>
      <div>It is the middle ground between the two previous functions. We can say that it creates a preparation feeling, but with less intensity and may migrate either to the dominant function (intensifying the tension) or to the tonic (resting).</div>
